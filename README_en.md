## Features

- **Visual Modeling**: Based on metadata driven, Steedos Platform abstracts the traditional business requirements realized by code into configurable metadata. By simply clicking the  tag to modify the configuration item, the vast majority of business requirements can be realized, and the code can be written if necessary.

- **Configure Validation Rules**: In Steedos Platform, users can create validation rules for each object. Validation rules are mainly used to verify whether the data of the object conforms to specific rules.
