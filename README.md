## Click, Not Code

Traditional programming, denotes the means of programming by using certain coding languages, to tell a computer exactly how to perform an action.Â 

On the other hand, declarative programming accomplishes the same results by basically telling the computer the end result and letting the computer figure out how to get there.

Steedos is such an declarative programmingÂ platform.Â  Steedos empowers business owners with all of the tools of a developer, without requiring an advanced skill set.Â 

With drag-and-drop simplicity, just about anyone can create apps that automate business processes. The apps you create for your business can be deployed on mobile, tablet and web, be simple or complex, and connect to nearly any data source.Â 


## Based on Metadata

Metadata is core to the steedos infrastructure. Metadata relates to the objects, fields, configurations, code, logic, and page layouts that go into building the information architecture and look and feel of your steedos apps.

Metadata can be imported into Steedos, modified in the product interface, or manipulated via the Steedos Metadata API.

There are several types of Metadata, with each one representing a unique way a business function can be customized. Here are a few broad categories for Metadata types:

- **Data**: the core components of the data structure on which most customization is built. E.g. Custom Objects, Fields, and Custom Apps.
- **Programmability**: custom code developed on top of the platform. E.g. Buttons, Form Events, Triggers.
- **Presentation**: customization on how users interact with the platform. E.g. Components, List View and Page Layouts.

## Features

- **Visual Modeling**: Based on metadata driven, Steedos Platform abstracts the traditional business requirements realized by code into configurable metadata. By simply clicking the  tag to modify the configuration item, the vast majority of business requirements can be realized, and the code can be written if necessary.

- **Define User Interface**: With Steedos Platform, you can quickly build list view page layout, reports, and dashboards to truly realize user-defined interface.

- **Configure Validation Rules**: In Steedos Platform, users can create validation rules for each object. Validation rules are mainly used to verify whether the data of the object conforms to specific rules. When a user changes a field of an object that does not conform to the validation rules created by the user, Hua will refuse to save the user's input.

- **Formula Engine**: Steedos Platform has built-in formula engine of the same level as Excel, which can realize automatic condition judgment, data calculation, reference of data in associated table or summary of relevant data in sub table by configuring formula.

- **Workflow Rules**: By setting workflow rules and recording that when the specified conditions are met, Steedos Platform will implement the automatic operation of the rules, so that the business can operate automatically without being on duty and drive efficiency improvement.

- **Automatic Operation**: By setting the automatic operation, you can automatically create and update records, send e-mail, SMS or notification in the system under specific conditions, and can also call the interface of the third-party system automatically.

- **Approval Process**: The system has built-in various tools, such as process design, process operation, management and maintenance, statistical analysis and process optimization, to help enterprises quickly deploy, effectively monitor and continuously optimize the business approval process.

- **Visual Report Tool**: With the report engine of Steedos Platform , you can quickly configure statistical charts, including data list, group report, PivotChart, bar chart, pie chart, etc., for easy viewing, analysis and decision-making.

- **Advanced Business logic Development**: Steedos Platform  provides an entry point for code development. Developers can realize high-level business logic such as automatic operation, stop and rollback under specific conditions by writing code. Or develop interfaces with third-party systems.

- **Open Source, Customizable**: Steedos Platform  is open source. This will make you confident that Steedos Platform will exist forever. You can also fork the source code down and make changes as needed.

## Steedos Package

A package is a container for something as small as an individual component or as large as a set of related apps. After creating a package, you can distribute it to other Steedos users and organizations, including those outside your company.

## Source-Driven Development

Steedos DX introduces a new way to organize your metadata and distribute your apps. You can now benefit from modern collaboration technologies such as Git to version control everything across your team - your code, your org configuration, and your metadata. 

![Steedos Overview](http://www.steedos.org/assets/platform/platform-overview.png)

To make this possible, we're enabling you to export your metadata, define data import files, and easily specify the edition, features, and configuration options of your development, staging, and production environments.

## Installation and Deployment

This project is the kernel source code of Steedos Platform. We will compile and release it as [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steedos-server) regularly.

You can create a new steedos project or install the following open source steedos projects.

- [Project Management App](https://github.com/steedos/project-management-app)
- [Customer Relationship Management](https://github.com/steedos/steedos-app-crm)
